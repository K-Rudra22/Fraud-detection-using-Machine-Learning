# Fraud-detection-using-Machine-Learning

A simple and interactive **Streamlit web application** that predicts whether a financial transaction is **fraudulent** or **legitimate** using a trained Machine Learning model.

##  Overview

This project demonstrates how machine learning can be used to detect fraudulent financial transactions.  
Users can input transaction details (like amount, balance, type of transaction, etc.) through a web interface, and the app will predict whether the transaction is likely to be **fraudulent (1)** or **legitimate (0)**.
